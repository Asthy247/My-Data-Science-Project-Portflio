# My-Data-Science-Project-Portfolio
Welcome to my comprehensive data science and analytics portfolio! This repository serves as a centralized collection of my projects, demonstrating my skills in data analysis, machine learning, visualization, and more.
# Projects Included:
# Project 1: Exploratory Analysis on Heart Dataset in SAS: 

This SAS Studio project analyzes SASHELP.HEART. It demonstrates data cleaning (filtering, handling missing values), feature engineering (BMI, BP categories), and descriptive statistics (means, frequencies). Using Base SAS, it reveals health trends, like blood pressure distributions across genders, showcasing data analysis, quality assessment, and visualization skills for a data analyst portfolio.
