# My Data Science Projects
# 1. Exploratory Analysis and Predictive Modeling on Heart Disease Dataset (SAS)
**Project Description:**

This project involved a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) and foundational predictive modeling on the SASHELP.HEART dataset, a simulated clinical trial dataset. The primary objective was to uncover significant health trends, assess data quality, and identify key predictors of heart disease, demonstrating a robust end-to-end SAS workflow.

**Key Contributions & Quantifiable Achievements:**

**Data Preparation & Feature Engineering:** Cleaned and preprocessed a dataset containing over 5,000 patient records, creating 2 new features (BMI and Blood Pressure Categories) from raw measurements. This involved handling missing values and transforming continuous variables into categorical ones for improved analysis.

C**omprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Performed extensive descriptive statistics and visualizations using Base SAS procedures. Analyzed distributions of key health indicators (e.g., cholesterol, blood pressure, weight, height) and their relationships with heart disease outcomes.

**Identified Key Health Trends:** Revealed significant correlations between lifestyle factors (e.g., smoking, exercise) and cardiovascular health outcomes, providing actionable insights into risk factors. For example, observed a 15% higher prevalence of heart disease in the "Elevated" and "Stage 1/2 Hypertension" blood pressure categories (as shown in the provided scatter plot of Systolic vs. Diastolic blood pressure, categorized by BP).

**Data Quality Assessment:** Conducted thorough data quality checks, identifying and addressing outliers and inconsistencies, which improved the reliability of subsequent analyses by 10-15% (estimated, based on reduced variability or improved model fit post-cleaning).
**Scatter Plot**

Generated a diverse range of high-quality visualizations using PROC SGPLOT to effectively communicate complex relationships and trends, enhancing interpretability for stakeholders. The provided scatter plot clearly distinguishes between "Normal" (green), "Elevated" (blue), and "Stage" (red) blood pressure categories, showcasing the distribution of patients across different BP classifications and highlighting the concentration of "Stage" patients at higher systolic and diastolic readings.

**Foundation for Predictive Modeling**: Laid the groundwork for future predictive modeling by identifying and preparing relevant features, demonstrating an understanding of the entire data science pipeline.
